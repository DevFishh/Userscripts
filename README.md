# Userscripts
Userscripts I have coded.\n
What is a userscript?
Userscripts are scripts which can be injected into a web browser with an extension/addon, and they can change many things
I use Tampermonkey for Google Chrome (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
This is one of the locations you can get my userscripts. 
Another (maybe more simplier way) is Greasy fork (https://greasyfork.org/en/users/946530-purefishmonke) where you can install a script with the click of a few buttons
