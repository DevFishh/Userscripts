# Userscripts
This respository contains Userscripts I have coded. 

What is a userscript?

Userscripts are lines of JavaScript code which can be injected into a web browser with an extension/addon, and they can change many things and perform many actions. 

For example, creating/inserting/changing HTML elements or even exploiting in games.
 
I use Tampermonkey for Google Chrome, which can be found here --> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en
 
GitHub is one of the locations you can get my userscripts. You can install them by copy and pasting the code into the script editor in your Userscript editor.
 
Another (maybe more simplier way) is by visiting my greasyfork.org account (https://greasyfork.org/en/users/946530-purefishmonke) where you can install a script with the click of a few buttons (as long as you have an extension like Tampermonkey and Greasemonkey). You can also find more scripts on there made by hundreds or thousands of different developers. However, you may want to be careful as some can contain malicious content.
