# Userscripts
Userscripts I have coded. 

What is a userscript?
Userscripts are lines of JavaScript code which can be injected into a web browser with an extension/addon, and they can change many things and perform many actions. 
For example, creating elements or even exploiting in games. 
I use Tampermonkey for Google Chrome (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en). 
GitHub is one of the locations you can get my userscripts. 
Another (maybe more simplier way) is Greasy fork (https://greasyfork.org/en/users/946530-purefishmonke) where you can install a script with the click of a few buttons (as long as you have an extension like Tampermonkey and Greasemonkey)
